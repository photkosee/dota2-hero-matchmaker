## Data

I convert a flowchart into a json object and treat it like a non-binary decision tree. The data is stored in `data.json` file.

## Originality
The idea of the flowchart is from a user named [StackBabber59](https://www.reddit.com/user/StackBabber59/) from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DotA2/comments/1d6te1m/i_made_a_handy_flowchart_to_help_people_decide/). The images used in this project are credited to the [Dota 2 official website](https://www.dota2.com/home).
